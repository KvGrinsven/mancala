# Mancala

This training project was aimed at gaining practice with web development. The application has been developed using an MVC design:
* the view consists of a React project that displays the current state of the game
* the controller consists of a Jersey REST API
* the object-oriented domain model* has been written in Java using a test-driven approach

*The API currently relies on a jar that had been provided for the assignment. The object-oriented domain model that I personally designed and implemented in an earlier project has been included for reference in the folder Alternative Domain.
